analyze_phone_lengths.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (58,64.5,58) frames.
At utterance begin, o_B accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (58,64.5,58) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,56.0,36) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 87.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,22.5,58) frames.
Overall, ʉ_E accounts for 19.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,14.7,16) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 12.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,45.2,49) frames.
Overall, ɾ_I accounts for 12.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,12.2,18) frames.
Overall, I_B accounts for 6.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,13.0,3) frames.
Overall, n_I accounts for 6.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,51.0,3) frames.
Overall, o_B accounts for 6.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (58,64.5,58) frames.
Overall, ɖ_I accounts for 6.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,19.0,9) frames.
Overall, ɳ_I accounts for 6.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,25.0,18) frames.
Overall, ʌ_I accounts for 6.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,21.5,20) frames.
Overall, aɪ_B accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
Overall, d_I accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, m_B accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.0,20) frames.
Overall, r_I accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, uː_I accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 12.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 7.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,34.5,20)
